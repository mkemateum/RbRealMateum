          <h1> The Canon</h1>
          <p class="canonparagraph1"><h3>Rules of the Game.</h3></p>
          The objective of the game is to checkmate the enemy's king. In the first turn, standard rules only apply. Starting in the second turn, players have three choices on how to play. A) move as normal. B) 'spin' one of your piece/s (make sure there are no enemy pieces on the 2x2 spinning area). C) make a normal move first, then 'spin' <b>only</b> the 2x2 area your piece moved in.
          <h4>Rules on 'Spinning'</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>All spins must be made along pre-existing 2x2 'spin' areas, as shown in the figure below. Spins are made by shifting every piece in the 2x2 area either 90 degrees left or right. You cannot spin on the first turn. Areas with your own or an enemy king cannot be spun.</li>

            <li>You cannot move a piece after you spin, as your turn ends when you do so. However, you can choose not to spin, or not to move a piece, as long as you choose to do one or both of the actions</li>
            <li>If you won't move a piece, you may spin any area that has <b>only</b> your own pieces. Otherwise, you may choose to spin the area your piece lands on.</li>
