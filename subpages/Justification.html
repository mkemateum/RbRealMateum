          <li><h3>It's a wonderful way to up your normal chess games!</h3></li>
          Spinchess is different enough from normal chess games such that it offers a lot of potential in terms of how one would develop strategies against their opponent, yet is similar enough such that it doesn't stray away too far from what one would expect in their average chess games. 
           <li><h3>The possibilities are endless!</h3></li>
           With the added benefit of 'spinning' pieces, there are many things we can do in spinchess that are normally not possible in the original chess games. One such thing is how pawns, assuming they're not obstructed by anything, can reach the other side of the board in just three moves (the pawn can move two spaces forward by moving and spinning). Another unique thing to spinchess is how the bishops can change their color at any time. Not only is this very convenient for those who had lost one of their bishops, but this also allows greater flexibility to those that have both, as it can allow both bishops to attack a single piece, or even more than one piece at once.
           <li><h3>Quick and easy to learn!</h3></li>
         </ol>
