## The Complications Of A Chess Variant

Almost everyone knows the game of chess. If not, then hopefully everyone has at least heard of it. Well some time ago, a few friends somehow invented a new and seemingly original variant of this classic board game, called Spinchess, called Gyration Chess by the humorous.

### What is Spinchess?

Spinchess is a new variant of chess invented by Matti Campos of 9-Lithium during a game night at the Boys Residence Hall Annex 2, which involves the pieces rotating around set 2x2 areas all over the board.

### How does it work?
Honestly, even after playing the game multiple times, we still are confused by this game, but at least we have a set of rules established. It just gets, a little confusing.
