## The Complications Of A Certain Chess Variant

Almost everyone knows the game of chess. If not, then hopefully everyone has at least heard of it. Well some time ago, a few friends somehow invented a new and seemingly original variant of this classic board game, called Spinchess, called Gyration Chess by the humorous. Spinchess is a new variant of chess invented by Matti Campos of 9-Lithium during a game night at the Boys Residence Hall Annex 2, which involves the pieces rotating around set 2x2 areas all over the board. Rotation isn't allowed when:
1. 2x2 area includes the king.
2. The 2x2 area overlaps with another 2x2 area.
3. It goes over the line which separates the chess board in half.

For reference, look at the image below.
