      <h1> The Complications of a Chess Variant</h1>
      <h2> Being Original</h2>
      A lot of people who have played chess have wondered what it would be like if their chess games had different rules. Oftentimes, more than one person can think of the same thing, and it would be a big problem if both of them decide to claim it as their own idea and make it public. To avoid this, we made sure that Spinchess is 100% new, searching it up on various websites with no results.
      <h2> Making it Work </h2>
      Spinchess was at first just a joke between the grade 9 dormers of Philippine Science High School - MC, but after a few games, we quickly realized its potential at being a proper chess variant. Matti Campos, inventor of spinchess, says <b class="quote">"I think it adds a new level of strategy to the game and makes it much more diverse in terms of what can be done"</b>. To further make it more viable for people to play, official rules are made, expanding on a lot of things including how each piece moves and how and when to 'spin'.
